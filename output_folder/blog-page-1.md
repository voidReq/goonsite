> "Something strange is going on here. Americans seem to be using two moral compasses. One directs our behavior when it comes to things like sex, family, drugs, and traditional forms of crime. A second provides us ethical guidance in the realm of career, money, and success" (14)

This is a really interesting take. I don't agree that we actually have two moral compasses. When you are so cynical to believe that since "everyone else is doing it", you "might as well do it as well", you don't really have a moral compass. You are only guided by getting as much benefit as possible. So, I think, really, our moral compass is limited, and we only use it on issues that are universally agreed upon as bad, rather than any gray areas, such as piracy: why should you care if the companies are losing profits? It's not like they care about you.
