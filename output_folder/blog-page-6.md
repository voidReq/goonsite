> "While it was Parke-Davis that conceived this troubling marketing effort and put up the money, its ultimate success hinged on the complicity of doctors â€“ many of whom willingly turned their patients into human guinea pigs and lied to their colleagues in order to make an easy buck" (55)

This reminded me of a situation in which the popular doctor and YouTuber Dr. Mike was invited to host a show on TV. This would have been really good for him, he would be able to spread his message about health awareness to a broader audience as well as get more money for it. However, he rejected the offer once realizing that he would be required to promote certain medical products that the TV show would give him. And since he couldn't check the effectiveness or the safety of the product, he would essentially be lying to his audience. Unfortunately, not all doctors have as much integrity as Dr. Mike, but it is a hopeful anecdote that not all doctors are bent on making profit.
