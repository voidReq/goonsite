> "The American résumé, in fact, is right up there with lawyers' timesheets and corporate earnings statements as among the most misleading documents around." (220)

In a book about cheating, it's hard to find any real continuity. You can talk about where cheating happens, such as with lawyers, with doctors, with corporations, or you can talk about the history of cheating. In this book, Callahan organizes cheating into categories, from the upper class, to the current chapter, cheating at school even before entering the job market. So, to connect back to previous ideas, Callahan makes references, such as "lawyers' timesheets" – referring back to when lawyers would inflate their timesheets to ridiculous amounts to keep up with quota and billable hours, and "corporate earnings" – the history of Enron.
