> "What happens when you think the system is stacked against people like you and you stop believing that the rules are fair?" (23)

I can relate to this a lot. When you are frustrated about something not being fair, for example when playing a game, it's a lot easier to justify cheating. However, this leads to a breakdown in society. As soon as you start assuming that others are not playing by the rules, and are out to take advantage of you, you stop communicating with them. You start isolating yourself from the people you perceive are cheating, and, overall, this means there is less trust and the society and community suffers.
