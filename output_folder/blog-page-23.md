> "I have met many other ethics entrepreneurs beyond these, and I find their efforts not just impressive, but reassuring. The cheating culture is being contested every day, with growing zeal and creativity." (307)

In the main book, it is mostly an outline of "current events" of 2004. It offers solutions, but doesn't end hopefully, instead, giving readers a choice to change for the better. However, this afterword helps to end the book on a true positive note. Callahan mentions several events that have occurred after the publishing of the book, that include court trials for people that, at the time of the book, were still walking free. The afterword encourages readers to continue being virtuous, and continue battling the temptation to cheat, because their efforts are paying off.
