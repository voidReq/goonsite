> "The managers of these large funds were under constant pressure to show results from their stock picks and they leaned on corporate leaders to boost profits – over a period not of many years, but of every quarter." (45)

It's the second time that the author has blamed the current cheating culture on the stock market. And it's an interesting theory: as people start to gravitate towards short term gains, corporations – that used to actually be very ethical – were forced to focus on the bottom-line: cutting corners where possible to maximize shareholder values, and provide the most quarterly earnings rather than setting themselves up for slower, long-term growth.
