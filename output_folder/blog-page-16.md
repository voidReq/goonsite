> "Exacting revenge against tyrannical cable companies strikes many Americans as a just cause if ever there was one. Those engaged in cable theft regularly cite the misdeeds of cable companies to justify their behavior. A favorite excuse uses the logic of expropriation – that the cable companies are making so much money by gouging consumers that they should be forced to pay some back." (190)

This is a very common excuse on why people pirate – they feel like they are morally justified in doing so. I personally understand the excuse because I use it as well when I pirate things. These are huge corporations, and they don't care about their customers, and I wasn't going to be a customer anyways, so why should it matter? What I didn't realize was that at the end of the day, no matter how "righteous" it seems, you are not participating in social activism. You are still stealing, and corporations become more greedy because of those lost profits, leading to a negative cycle.
