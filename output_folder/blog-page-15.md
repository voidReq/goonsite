>  "Writing in the mid-twentieth century, the sociologist Robert Merton observed that Americans are taught that everyone can succeed if they work hard enough. America was a 'society which places a high premium on economic affluence and social ascent for all its members.' But Merton also pointed out that there is no 'corresponding emphasis upon the legitimate avenues on which to march toward this goal.' Americans worshipped financial success without being too concerned about how people got ahead … These pressures were especially poisonous, Merton said, in a nation where not everyone actually could succeed – where there were limits on the economic opportunities that were available" (173)

This is both a very interesting perspective and it also adds to the author's credibility. First, it adds to the author's credibility because this passage was written in the mid-twentieth century. The cheating that the author has been writing about has had its roots in American history for a long time. Second, it's a very interesting perspective because America is unique in that it very much emphasizes the freedom of economic opportunity and mobility. So, when people are literally taught by their culture that they are expected to be able to move upward on the social ladder, it's easy to forget that they don't place as much importance on moving upwards legitimately.
