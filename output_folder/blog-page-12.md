> "At the same time, our lack of sympathy for life's losers makes us less prone to outrage when ordinary people are exploited by powerful cheaters. We are as likely to blame the victim as the villain. For example, in the aftermath of corporate scandals, a member of commentators pooh-poohed the losses of those who invested in Enron â€¦'They failed to follow the common sense rules of asset diversification'" (126)

Since it is believed that America is an "even playing field" and the only way to get rich is through hard work, the wealthy become admired for their moral righteousness. This is a really interesting perspective on how we view class society, and it is a good explanation of the callousness towards the poor that many people have. Why help them if they are "lazy" and "brought it on themselves"? Unfortunately, it seems that America still believes in the "even playing field" even though it doesn't exist anymore, and that more people are cheating to get to the top instead.
