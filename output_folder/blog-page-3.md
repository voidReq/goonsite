> "You realize that headquarters is expecting everyone to work harder for the same amount of money. Management also makes it clear that anyone who doesn't meet the quotas may be fired.

The author is really good at creating relatable hypothetical scenarios. By working through the scenario through the lens of the affected person, they come to a natural decision that readers can also empathize with. Here, no car mechanic wants to lie and push for unnecessary changes, but the corner-cutting of corporations has forced them to do this, because their livelihood depends on it. Cheating happens best when it's opaque â€“ the corporations don't know their mechanics are doing this, and most car owners aren't smart enough to realize.
