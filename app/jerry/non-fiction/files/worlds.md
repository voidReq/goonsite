> "He couldn't stand to know about his mother because that's not how he wanted the story to go – and he wouldn't have any other story. So he tore up the world. It's the same way he tore me up – Abra – when he wanted to be a priest." (576)

Making up reality is a recurring theme in this book. Cathy is a prime example. Mr. Edwards, for example, never saw past Cathy other than a beautiful girl. So, after drinking alcohol, and finding out the truth, he tries to kill her. Adam, when he marries Cathy, doesn't really marry Cathy, but rather the Cathy in Adam's mind. For example, he doesn't ever listen to her when she says she doesn't want to move to California. He also doesn't notice Cathy's lack of interest in the property they buy. Making up dreams is human nature. Everyone does it. But, the problem is when it becomes reality. One recurring theme is trying to escape reality – either by enlisting in the army or making up truths. It's always ended up being that reality catches up with the character, and it breaks them. Those who can't accept reality can't change reality. It's easy to escape, but that's only temporary solace. The only true solution is to try to fight reality, and change it. Which is much harder, and isn't always possible.
