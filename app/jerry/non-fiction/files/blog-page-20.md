title: Tough and Fair American
order: 268

> "'These steps should appeal to both sides of the American character: each asks a lot of people, as the Tough American demands; yet each holds out real rewards, as the Fair American suggests. And all four envision the government not as the sole solution to our problems, but as a catalyst for action that leverages its resources in partnership with the private and nonprofit sectors." (268)

By recognizing that the American ethos is made up of both a "tough american" who expects people to work hard and to "toughen up", as well as a "fair american" who believes that everyone deserves an opportunity to succeed, Callahan is able to build ethos as he demonstrates he understands the cheating problem well, and so his suggestions for how to fix the situation is more credible, and more in-line with reality.
