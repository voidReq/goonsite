> "Ken Caminiti was a third baseman for the San Diego Padres when he began taking banned steroids in 1996 to help overcome an injury. Caminiti did more than just heal. He played as never before â€“ with 40 home runs, 130 RBIs, and a .326 batting average. 'At first I felt like a cheater,' Caminiti told Sports Illustrated. 'But I looked around, and everybody was doing it.'" (75)

This passage is really representative of the whole message of the book. First, the author builds a lot of logos. He uses a variety of numbers to help support his point, as well as putting his claims into perspective. Second, Callahan directly quotes Caminiti saying "everyone was doing it", which is exactly one of the claims that Callahan repeatedly makes: people normalize cheating because they see everyone else is doing it.
