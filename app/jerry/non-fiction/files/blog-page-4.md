> "One day, not too long after you start practicing law, … you just won't have much to show for your efforts in terms of billable hours. … So what you'll do is pad your time sheet just a bit… and before long, you will be stealing from your clients almost every day, and you won't even notice it." (39)

I can understand this sequence of events very well. I think, in general, people can get normalized to something very fast. By that, I mean, they can build habits really quickly, especially if they are bad habits. Bad habits are so prevalent specifically because it is so easy to create them – the correct way to do something is often hard, and has a lot of barriers. So, psychologically, you would go for the easiest path. And, I think this applies to cheating as well. People can lose their integrity so quickly, without even realizing it, because, like bad habits, it benefits them a lot, and they are rarely punished.
