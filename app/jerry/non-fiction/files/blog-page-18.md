> "“It doesn’t do a lot for the depositors’ confidence when they read in the newspaper that their bank just nabbed a crooked loan officer, " said Wells."As a result many businesses simply fire dishonest employees, who then are unwittingly hired by other companies.”" (238)

This is a common structure that the author uses throughout the book. First, he talks about a problem related to cheating, whether that be of lawyers, of students, or of athletes. Then, he talks about how the high stakes of American society has forced these people to cheat, because it's the only way to keep up. He includes quotes from other people to support his claim that cheating is widespread and is a big problem. It's a good strategy because talking about cheating is hard because there are so many ways to cheat. So, in order for this book to have the broadest reach possible, he needs to include a lot of examples of cheating.
