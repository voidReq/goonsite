It's an interesting perspective to consider: people are unhappy even though they have a great quality of life. They still want more (and therefore cheat to do so), because they are comparing themselves to the people that are even more successful than them. If you had a salary of $110,000, but you worked around people that made $200,000, you would be unhappy, even though you have a great salary. And that is a much harder psychological problem to solve than just blaming the stock market forcing people to optimize for the bottom line.
