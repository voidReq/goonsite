> "For what it's worth, my advice to those who cheat or are around cheating boils down to two simple ideas: one, go ahead and be a chump; and two, don't hesitate to be a pain in the ass." (293)

This is very difficult advice to follow, because personally, I have the experience that it is better to go out of the way, to not be a hassle, to not be the "odd one out", and to not take up other peoples' time. And I think a majority of Americans share this opinion. To be fair, it's a lot easier to "go with the flow" and do what's natural. It's much harder to take a stance, and to take up other peoples' time and fight for your beliefs. It's necessary, but it's hard.
