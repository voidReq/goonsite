> "In June 2003, six former Xerox executives settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $22 million but – you guessed it – admitting to no wrongdoing" (144)

The author keeps on mentioning these scandals, but most importantly, "admitting to no wrongdoing". Unfortunately, it seems that while the companies are being punished, the punishments are still quite small – they aren't so public as to damage the company's reputation. They just have to pay a small fine quietly, and don't have to announce that they did anything wrong. And without that kind of accountability, getting caught for cheating has less of a consequence.
