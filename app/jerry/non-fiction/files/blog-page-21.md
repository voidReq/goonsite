> "The grotesque materialism of U.S. society is not only bad because it makes people look endlessly inward, creating competitive anxieties about status, looks, and class position. It is not only bad because it has created intense spending pressures on people at a time when many households have been running in place economically. Nor is it only bad because of its destructive environmental consequences. Excessive personal consumption is also bad because it drains national resources away from more important spending that could strengthen our communities and elevate our quality of life." (278)

By using repetition, "not only bad because … , it is not only bad because … nor is it only bad because …", Callahan is really able to drive home the point that excessive spending is bad. Materialism has so many consequences, from creating anxiety and pressure, as well as draining resources that could have been used more productively. This repetition structure strengthens the argument, because all of these reasons are powerful and valid, and listing them all together really emphasizes to the reader that materialism culture is a huge problem in America.
