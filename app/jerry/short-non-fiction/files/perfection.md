> "Does a craftsman, even in his old age, lose his hunger to make a perfect cup â€“ thin, strong, translucent?" (598)

This is a very thought provoking question. It's a common saying that perfection can't be reached, we can only strive for it. But it's interesting to project that onto humanity as a whole. We are constantly improving, every generation builds from the knowledge of the previous generation, and we are able to keep making technological advancements. And so when you tie that back into choice, free will in this context makes a lot of sense. You can't wield free will perfectly every time, but, like the craftsman, you never stop trying, never stop making decisions, in the hope that eventually, you'll make the perfect decision, whatever that may mean.
