## [Pink squirrels and green sharks—why do so many animals ‘glow’ in UV light?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/why-animals-glow-uv-ultraviolet-light)

> '“We can go underwater and revisit some of these animals that were described for the first time hundreds of years ago,” says Gruber. “We can see them in a new light and find things that are meaningful to them and to their world that we just hadn’t known before, because we didn’t have the tools to examine them.”'

By ending with a quote by a scientist, it ties back the whole article and is a great way to remind readers the purpose of investigating these bioluminescent creatures. It reminds readers that animals are so much more complex than we first thought, and UV light is only one aspect of this: as humans, we can't see UV light, so scientists never really considered investigating whether other animals can glow under UV light. But, as more research and more tools are made available, we learn more about how animals see, and how they see differently from us – how they actually can see UV light, and how that shapes the way they evolve and behave in the wild.
