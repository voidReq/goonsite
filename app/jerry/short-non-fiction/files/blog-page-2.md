> "And this is what makes the new snake study so interesting."

The article transitions between ideas using short sentences. Before, the article was building up one theory on why animals glow under UV light: it's useful for reproduction, for example it can "guide pollinators to their flowers". However, this sentence serves as a meaningful segue to a new study about snakes under UV light: they don't use it for reproduction, but rather it serves a camouflage purpose. The sentence builds up expectation for this new idea, and hints that the snake study is so interesting because it will be different from the theory that readers have just read.
