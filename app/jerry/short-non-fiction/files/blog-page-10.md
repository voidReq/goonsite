> "But Trump's characterisation of a "total reset" in relations may be overly optimistic as there is a slight sting in the tail in Beijing's statement. The Commerce Ministry ended with a reminder of who it sees as being in the wrong."

This is a noticeable shift in the article. Before, the article outlined the events that have since happened have been relatively positive. Neither China nor the US want to decouple, and both have since started negotiations, and lowered their reciprocal tariffs. However, this sentence marks a shift in the positive rhetoric. Things are not all perfect, and the tariffs are only going to last 90 days. This isn't the end of the trade war, and readers should not be too optimistic for any resolutions.
