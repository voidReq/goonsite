> '“Trees have always been important across cultures,” says Provan. “If this had happened in Japan, this would have been immensely important; in Shinto, it would have destroyed the home of a God. In the West, we bring in Christmas trees to celebrate the end of the year. Trees are highly significant figures in any landscape.”'

This is a really interesting perspective on trees that I haven't thought about before. Trees are indeed very deeply rooted in our culture. However, they are also very invisible, and personally, I've never really realized how much trees are rooted in our society. They are quintessential parts of any outdoor environment, and trees also delineate the border between cities and nature. So, it really does make sense why there would be so much outrage about the sycamore tree being cut down: it has been etched into the British ethos, and people have built memories and culture around that tree. So, when it was cut down, it felt like an attack on their culture and their memories.
