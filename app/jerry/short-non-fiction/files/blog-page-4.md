## [Pink squirrels and green sharks—why do so many animals ‘glow’ in UV light?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/why-animals-glow-uv-ultraviolet-light)

> '“It’s really easy to get hung up on this being like some amazing, super-secret,” says Crowell. “When in reality, we just have to treat it like any other color. Like, there are scenarios where green will help you hide, and scenarios where green is terrible to have, because you'll stand out.”'

This is an important takeaway from the whole article. UV light is just like any other light, and just because it is so rare and unique for us humans to see, it doesn't mean that it's so unique for animals. For example, blue is a really rare color in nature because it wasn't until recently that life has even evolved to be able to see the color! So, the article reminds readers that what may seem strange to humans doesn't necessarily mean it is strange for animals, and we have to adopt an open mind, and find analogies to understand new things – in this case, thinking of UV light as just another color.
